# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

The aim of the project was to understand the sentiment behind popular/trending topics on Twitter. A popular hashtag was selected and the overall sentiment of the tweets containing that word were analysed here. Overall tweet score was calculated depending on the number of positive, negative words in the tweet. Positive and negative words were compared with the positive and negative words dictionary easily available on the internet. Stop words were removed from tweets before assigning a score.
